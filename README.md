A vehicle tracking project involves developing a system to monitor and manage vehicles' locations and statuses in real-time.
This system typically includes GPS hardware installed in vehicles, a backend server to collect and process location data, and a frontend application to display the information to users.
Key functionalities include real-time tracking, route history, geofencing, alerts for deviations, and data analytics for optimizing fleet operations. 
The project aims to improve vehicle security, operational efficiency, and overall management.
